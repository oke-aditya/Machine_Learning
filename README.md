## What is this repo for ?
- This repo serves as a ready reference for ML libraries that I use.
- Tutorials, examples for Machine Learning.

## Did you write all the code ?
- I have learn't from these notebooks. The first step to learning is re-implementing the same thing.
- I have read these notebooks and tried their implementations.
- I try to understand the principles of ML from these stuff.

# What should I do with this repo ?
- Please let me know if there are any mistakes raise an issue or PR.
- Also for someone trying to learn from these. Hope you like the content.

# I want to add notebooks for more tools, concepts 
- You are welcome, please raise a PR.

# Credits for the code: -
- Francois Chollet's book Deep Learning in Python.
- Also ML, NLTK and Q learning notebooks are from Sentdex www.pythonprogramming.net
- Most ML notebooks are scikit-learn implementations as given in documentation.
- Thanks to Srivatsan sir's course for the RAPIDS, AutoML and Spark notebooks.
- Learning Tensorflow is from tf docs. It is an excellent resource.
- The Kaggle submissions are my codes. They aren't take from any resource. 

Please let me know if I miss any credits.
