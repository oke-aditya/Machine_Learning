Amazing quality content sir ..
Key take aways:

1) Model deployment has patterns depending on priority of business process
e.g. it may be that speed is the key(real time) or it can be processing huge volumes of data overnight or monthly (batch jobs).

2) Below are the patterns and they are ordered from simple to hard(typically):
2.1 complete Batch - e.g. historical data accumulated over time e.g. Quaterly risk assessment .
Infra - may need distributed computing to process huge volume of data .Spark ML . 

2.2 Near Real time - No need to finish in micro or milli second & need not give response back to customer.
e.g. capture events in business and show on dashboard

2.3 Real time - need to respond to customer asap as it may result in business loss
e.g. credit card transaction fraud detection

2.4 Edge - deployed on low powered ,low CPU , low memory devices e.g. phone , raspberry PI . 
Model needs to be memory efficient . May have to develop simple models or do post model pruning .
